Simulation of evolving vegetarian spiecies on 2d map.
Each of Animals holds it's DNA which translates to how one is likely to rotate left/right/move forward/stay in place etc.
When 2 animals meet they combine their DNA into a child which with system of dying spiecies that cant find food themselves creates one dominant DNA squence.
